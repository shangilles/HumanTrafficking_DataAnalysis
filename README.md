# HumanTrafficking_DataAnalysis

In this project, I used Human Trafficking data for Analysis. Though, the data contains the information for the various countries, but I used Data for USA only and mined the data for answering the questions such as the following-

1. How many incidents of Trafficking were reported across the years?
2. What is the ratio of Male to Female Victims?
3. The most common type of control in human trafficking in the United States?
4. The most common type of human trafficking the United States? (You will have to filter by counter)
5. The age group most affected by human trafficking?
6. Is there a correlation between forced labor and sexual exploitation?
7. Are victims most likely to be related to their abusers?
8.
